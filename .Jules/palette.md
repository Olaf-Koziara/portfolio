**Learning:** Core UI controls like theme toggles and language switchers often lack descriptive, localized ARIA labels. A "Skip to Content" link is a high-impact, low-effort accessibility win for keyboard users.
**Action:** Always check for missing alt text, localized ARIA labels, and skip links in new projects. Ensure Next.js Image components have alt props and appropriate layout configurations.

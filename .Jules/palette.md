## 2025-05-15 - Accessible Navigation and Hygiene
**Learning:** Adding accessibility features often requires structural changes (like adding a `<main>` tag) and new translations. Maintaining repository hygiene by cleaning up temporary logs and lockfiles is as important as the code quality itself.
**Action:** Always verify the file list before submitting and ensure only intended changes are staged. Use `getTranslations` in server components for SEO-friendly and localized accessibility links.
